# 18) NoSQL-Social-Network-API

An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. For this project I utilised the following technologies: 
* Javascript
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
